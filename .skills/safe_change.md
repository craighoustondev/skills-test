# Skill: Safe Change & Fast Feedback

## Purpose
Promote small, incremental changes and fast feedback loops.

## When to consult
- Planning how to implement a multi-step task
- Deciding whether to split a PR or commit
- Reviewing the size of files or changes

## Instructions
- Break work into small, understandable units.
- Keep files and modules manageable; avoid large files.
- Move changes into production quickly to shorten feedback loops.
- Encourage reviewing small units before moving to the next.

## Failure modes to watch
- Bundling multiple changes together for convenience.
- Waiting too long to push changes for perfection.
- Creating large files or modules that are hard to reason about.
